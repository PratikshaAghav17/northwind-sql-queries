18. Find all employees who report to ‘Andrew Fuller’
SELECT E.Employee_ID, E.First_Name, E.Last_Name
FROM Employees AS E
JOIN Employees AS Manager ON E.Reports_To = Manager.Employee_ID
WHERE Manager.First_Name = 'Andrew' AND Manager.Last_Name = 'Fuller';

This query involves joining the Employees table with itself, creating a self-join. It matches the ReportsTo column of the employees with the EmployeeID column of the manager.
The WHERE clause is used to filter the result to retrieve only the rows where the manager's first name is 'Andrew' and last name is 'Fuller'.
