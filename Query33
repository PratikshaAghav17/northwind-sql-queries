33. Find the suppliers who supply the top 5 most sold products
SELECT Suppliers.Supplier_ID, Suppliers.Company_Name, COUNT(Order_Details.Product_ID) AS ProductCount
FROM Suppliers
JOIN Products ON Suppliers.Supplier_ID = Products.Supplier_ID
JOIN Order_Details ON Products.Product_ID = Order_Details.Product_ID
GROUP BY Suppliers.Supplier_ID, Suppliers.Company_Name
ORDER BY ProductCount DESC
LIMIT 5;


This query involves joining the Suppliers, Products, and OrderDetails tables. It matches the SupplierID column between the Suppliers and Products tables, and the ProductID column between the Products and OrderDetails tables.
The COUNT(OrderDetails.ProductID) function is used to count the number of times each product supplied by a supplier appears in the OrderDetails table.
The results are grouped by SupplierID and CompanyName, and the product count is calculated for each supplier.
The results are then sorted in descending order based on the product count using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 5 statement is used to retrieve only the top 5 rows, which represent the suppliers who supply the most sold products.
