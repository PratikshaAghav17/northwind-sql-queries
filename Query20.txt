20. List the top 5 employees who have processed the most orders
SELECT Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name, COUNT(Orders.Order_ID) AS OrderCount
FROM Employees
JOIN Orders ON Employees.Employee_ID = Orders.Employee_ID
GROUP BY Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name
ORDER BY OrderCount DESC
LIMIT 5;

This query involves joining the Employees and Orders tables on the EmployeeID column. The COUNT() function is used to calculate the number of orders processed by each employee, based on the OrderID column from the Orders table.
The results are grouped by EmployeeID, FirstName, and LastName. The ORDER BY clause sorts the result in descending order based on the order count. The LIMIT keyword is used to limit the result to the top 5 rows.
