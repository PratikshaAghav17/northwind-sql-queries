24. Find the order with the highest total cost
SELECT Orders.Order_ID, SUM(Order_Details.Quantity * Order_Details.Unit_Price) AS TotalCost
FROM Orders
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
GROUP BY Orders.Order_ID
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC
LIMIT 1;

This query involves joining the Orders and OrderDetails tables on the OrderID column. It uses the SUM() function to calculate the total cost of each order by multiplying the Quantity column with the UnitPrice column from the OrderDetails table.
The results are grouped by OrderID and then sorted in descending order based on the total cost using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 1 statement is used to retrieve only the first row, which represents the order with the highest total cost.
