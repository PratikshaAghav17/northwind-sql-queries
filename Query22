SELECT DISTINCT Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name
FROM Employees
JOIN Orders ON Employees.Employee_ID = Orders.Employee_ID
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
JOIN Products ON Order_Details.Product_ID = Products.Product_ID
WHERE Products.Product_Name = 'Chai';


This query involves joining the Employees, Orders, OrderDetails, and Products tables. It matches the EmployeeID column between the Employees and Orders tables, the OrderID column between the Orders and OrderDetails tables, and the ProductID column between the OrderDetails and Products tables.
The WHERE clause is used to filter the result and retrieve only the rows where the ProductName in the Products table is 'Chai'.
