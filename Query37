This query involves joining the Products and OrderDetails tables. It calculates the total quantity sold for each product by summing the Quantity column from the OrderDetails table.
The CASE statement is used to classify products based on their sales volume into different categories: 'High Sales', 'Medium Sales', and 'Lower Sales'. It compares the total quantity sold with specific thresholds and assigns the corresponding category based on the conditions provided.
The results are grouped by ProductID and ProductName, and the total quantity and sales category are calculated for each product.
The results are then sorted in descending order based on the total quantity using the ORDER BY clause.
