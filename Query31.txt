31. Find the top 3 customers who have ordered the most products
SELECT Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name, COUNT(Order_Details.Product_ID) AS ProductCount
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.Customer_ID = Orders.Customer_ID
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
GROUP BY Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name
ORDER BY ProductCount DESC
LIMIT 3;

This query involves joining the Customers, Orders, and OrderDetails tables. It matches the CustomerID column between the Customers and Orders tables, and the OrderID column between the Orders and OrderDetails tables.
The COUNT(OrderDetails.ProductID) function is used to count the number of products ordered by each customer.
The results are grouped by CustomerID and CompanyName, and the product count is calculated for each customer.
The results are then sorted in descending order based on the product count using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 3 statement is used to retrieve only the top 3 rows, which represent the customers who have ordered the most products.
