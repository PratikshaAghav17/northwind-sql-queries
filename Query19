19. Find the customers who have spent more than $5000 in total
SELECT Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name, SUM(Order_Details.Quantity * Order_Details.Unit_Price) AS TotalSpent
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.Customer_ID = Orders.Customer_ID
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
GROUP BY Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name
HAVING TotalSpent > 5000;

This query involves joining the Customers, Orders, and OrderDetails tables. It matches the CustomerID column between the Customers and Orders tables, and the OrderID column between the Orders and OrderDetails tables.
The SUM() function is used to calculate the total amount spent by each customer by multiplying the Quantity column with the UnitPrice column from the OrderDetails table.
The results are grouped by CustomerID and CompanyName, and the HAVING clause is used to filter the result and retrieve only the customers with a total amount spent greater than $5000.
