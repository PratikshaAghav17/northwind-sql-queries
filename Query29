SELECT ( Orders.Order_Date) AS Month, SUM(Order_Details.Quantity * Order_Details.Unit_Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Orders
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
WHERE YEAR(Orders.Order_Date) = 2016
GROUP BY (Orders.Order_Date)
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;


This query calculates the total sales for each month in the year 2016 by joining the Orders and OrderDetails tables on the OrderID column. The SUM() function is used to calculate the total sales by multiplying the Quantity column with the UnitPrice column from the OrderDetails table.
The WHERE clause is used to filter the result and retrieve only the orders placed in the year 2016.
The results are grouped by the month of the OrderDate using the DATEPART() function.
The results are then sorted in descending order based on the total sales using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 1 statement is used to retrieve only the first row, which represents the month with the highest total sales in the year 2016.
