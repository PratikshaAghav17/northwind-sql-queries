32. Find the employees who have not processed any orders
SELECT Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Employees.Employee_ID = Orders.Employee_ID
WHERE Orders.Employee_ID IS NULL;

This query uses a LEFT JOIN to retrieve all employees from the Employees table, regardless of whether they have any corresponding orders in the Orders table.
The WHERE clause filters the result and retrieves only the employees whose EmployeeID does not have a match in the Orders table, indicated by Orders.EmployeeID IS NULL.
