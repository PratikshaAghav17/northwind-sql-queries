23. Find the most common shipping country
SELECT Ship_Country, COUNT(*) AS ShipmentCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Ship_Country
ORDER BY ShipmentCount DESC
LIMIT 1;

This query selects the ShipCountry column from the Orders table and uses the COUNT(*) function to count the number of occurrences for each unique shipping country.
The results are grouped by ShipCountry and then sorted in descending order based on the shipment count using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 1 statement is used to retrieve only the first row, which represents the most common shipping country with the highest shipment count.
