26. Find the customer who has ordered the most ‘Chai’ product
SELECT Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name, SUM(Order_Details.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.Customer_ID = Orders.Customer_ID
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
JOIN Products ON Order_Details.Product_ID = Products.Product_ID
WHERE Products.Product_Name = 'Chai'
GROUP BY Customers.Customer_ID, Customers.Company_Name
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1;


This query involves joining the Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, and Products tables. It matches the CustomerID column between the Customers and Orders tables, the OrderID column between the Orders and OrderDetails tables, and the ProductID column between the OrderDetails and Products tables.
The WHERE clause is used to filter the result and retrieve only the rows where the ProductName in the Products table is 'Chai'.
The results are grouped by CustomerID and CompanyName. The SUM() function is used to calculate the total quantity of 'Chai' products ordered by each customer.
The results are then sorted in descending order based on the total quantity using the ORDER BY clause.
The LIMIT 1 statement is used to retrieve only the first row, which represents the customer who has ordered the most 'Chai' product.
