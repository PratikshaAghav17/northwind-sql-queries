25. Find the employees who have processed more than 100 orders
SELECT Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name, COUNT(Orders.Order_ID) AS OrderCount
FROM Employees
JOIN Orders ON Employees.Employee_ID = Orders.Employee_ID
GROUP BY Employees.Employee_ID, Employees.First_Name, Employees.Last_Name
HAVING COUNT(Orders.Order_ID) > 100;

This query involves joining the Employees and Orders tables on the EmployeeID column. The COUNT() function is used to calculate the number of orders processed by each employee, based on the OrderID column from the Orders table.
The results are grouped by EmployeeID, FirstName, and LastName. The HAVING clause is used to filter the result and retrieve only the employees with an order count greater than 100.
