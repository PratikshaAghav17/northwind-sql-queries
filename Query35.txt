35. Find the total sales for each year
SELECT YEAR(Orders.Order_Date) AS OrderYear, SUM(Order_Details.Quantity * Order_Details.Unit_Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Orders
JOIN Order_Details ON Orders.Order_ID = Order_Details.Order_ID
GROUP BY OrderYear
ORDER BY OrderYear;

This query involves joining the Orders and OrderDetails tables on the OrderID column. The SUM() function is used to calculate the total sales by multiplying the Quantity column with the UnitPrice column from the OrderDetails table.
The YEAR() function is used to extract the year from the OrderDate column in the Orders table.
The results are then grouped by OrderYear, and the total sales are calculated for each year.
The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in ascending order based on the OrderYear.
